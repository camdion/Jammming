# Hello! 

This is my first real project so bare with me. :)

## What is this thing?

This is a playlist app using the spotify API. The purpose of this project is to learn more about react, get practice with APIs, and overall learn independently about web development workflows. The requirements for this project can be found on Codecademy and have also been included below.

### Requirements

1. Build a web app using React
2. Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
3. Integrate with Spotify or another API
Deploy your application
4. Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project, including:
    1. The purpose of your project
    2. Technologies used
    3. Features
    4. Future work


### Features:
1. Users can search for songs by song title.
    - You can also include functionality to search by other a attributes like artist’s name, genre, etc.
3. Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried
